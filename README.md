# Wikihow Dungeon

### An AI Dungeon inspired game trained using Wikihow to generate puzzles

We are providing an interactive text-based game experience where the players try to solve puzzles from WikiHow articles. Such articles can either be pre-existing articles from the WikiHow database or they can be generated by training a transformer based GPT-2 model on the WikiHow article dataset. Each game experience involves telling the player the goal of the article, and asking them to guess the correct steps from a given list of options each time in order to solve the puzzle. Our project has multiple moving parts such as parsing the articles to extract steps and descriptions, running an imperative check on steps to determine which steps require an action, changing the descriptions to be printed after every action from third-person to second-person, finding articles similar to the game article for extracting wrong choice options per step, grouping articles into 20-30 predetermined categories for the player to pick from if they choose to and creating a GPT-2 model to train on the WikiHow dataset and generate new exciting puzzles. What makes our project interesting is we are using a very wide variety of WikiHow articles to provide a fun interactive experience. WikiHow is a website known for its ’How To’ articles on almost any topic one can think of and it is also a rich source for NLP research. However, there isn’t much work in the field that focuses on how such articles can be used to create interactive text adventure games, thus our project opens space for a lot of further work to be done in this area.
